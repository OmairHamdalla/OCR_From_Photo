Hello,

I am omair and i am training on OCR
I am just writing more and more texts to see how the code would take different lines
so more and more lines are being wrriteen here just to test the power of this tool.
It is essential to use this tool with python libraries

Especially here:

Woooo, this is a weird place for text

Whats this text?

from PIL import Image
import pytesseract
